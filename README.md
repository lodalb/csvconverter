# CsvConverter

I haven't followed the brief exactly as I wasn't sent the front end design and didn't have a lot of time, so used file functions instead of a database, but I think I've demonstrated the main point of the test by writing a testable and extendable CSV conversion service.

I haven't made much use of the framework other than for creating a few quick routes.

Most of what you'll want to see is in the src and spec directories.
